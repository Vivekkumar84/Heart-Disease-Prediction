# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
Heart disease, also known as cardiovascular disease, is a term that refers to a number of conditions that affect the heart or blood vessels.


## Problem Statement
The problem statement for heart disease prediction is to help people with cardiovascular disease (CVD) or those at high risk of CVD get early detection and management.

Steps and Tasks :
Step 1 : Reading and understanding of data
Step 2 : Data cleaning and Preparation
Step 3 : Exploratory Data Analysis
Step 4 : Deriving new features
Step 5 : Train-Test Split and feature scaling
Step 6 : Model Building
Step 7 : Accuracy and Evaluation

## Mchine Learning algorithm used:
Logistic Regression:Logistic regression is a data analysis technique that uses mathematics to find the relationships between two data factors. It then uses this relationship to predict the value of one of those factors based on the other. The prediction usually has a finite number of outcomes, like yes or no.
